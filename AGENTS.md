# AGENTS.md — Vanguard CRM Kanban Dashboard (onlyoffice-crm-kanban)

**Current version:** 2.2.1 (released 2026-07-08; see CHANGELOG.md)  
**Last session summary (for next resume):** 
- **Phase 8d: Feedback fixes, log improvements, retrain fix (2026-07-14 evening).**
  - Fixed feedback popup closing on deal selection (ISSUE-013): `e.stopPropagation()` on deal option click handlers in both inbox and log feedback popups.
  - Fixed feedback cross-referencing in log: `fbByConv` map now keeps entry with most data (not first).
  - Fixed `_detect_mailbox()` not detecting requests@ action inbox (ISSUE-014): added `_extract_email_addresses()` helper for complex CRM `to` field objects, added more key variants (`toAddress`, `recipients`), added `from_email` fallback. **Must rebuild scanner container on CRM droplet.**
  - Fixed retrain ML Head using system Python (ISSUE-012): now prefers `.venv-ml/bin/python3`. Installed `sentence-transformers` in `.venv-ml`.
  - Log feedback corrections visible: colored brackets `[✓ verified correct]` / `[✗ corrected → rule:... → deal:...]`.
  - Log Export CSV button with Tabler `file-type-csv` icon.
  - Scanner admin tab buttons aligned left next to "Auto Mail Scanner" title.
  - Updated `config.example.env` with correct CRM droplet IP (68.183.130.39).
  - Files: `mail_scanner.py`, `public/app.js`, `public/index.html`, `config.example.env`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `ISSUES.md`, `AGENTS.md`.
- **Phase 8c: Mail UI bug fixes + major layout rework (2026-07-14).**
  - Fixed "filtered is not defined" crash (ISSUE-011): three stale `filtered` references left after filter removal replaced with `msgs` in `renderMailList()`.
  - Fixed inbox feedback popup invisible: `.mail-feedback-popup-wrap` missing `position: relative`.
  - Fixed log feedback "Wrong" crash: missing `.mail-feedback-choices` wrapper div in popup HTML.
  - Fixed `searchOpportunitiesByTitle(q, 8)` call signature → `{ limit: 8 }`.
  - Status tab redesigned to two-column layout: left = status grid + retrain + rules legend; right = behavior toggles + credentials form. Identity/Behavior tabs removed and merged into Status.
  - Assignee Rules tab redesigned to two-column grid (`.scanner-rules-grid`).
  - Log tab: feedback button added next to Reprocess Selected (single-entry, dropdown with full correction form).
  - Mail inbox terminal look: monospace green from, gray-blue subject, dashed row borders.
  - Chain-link icon for scanner-linked emails with deal name tooltip.
  - Removed: CRM/REQ filter buttons, badge CSS, old inline feedback buttons.
  - `page_size` 50→100 in `mail_scanner.py` (seed + poll).
  - Files: `app.js`, `styles.css`, `index.html`, `mail_scanner.py`, `AGENTS.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `ISSUES.md`.
- **Phase 8: Tag/Feedback Learning System (2026-07-12).**
  - Mail tag add/remove UI in CRM Mail Quick View (Inbox tab): `fetchMailTags`, `addMailTag`, `removeMailTag`, tag dropdown button renamed to "Add Tags" with checkboxes + partial-state indicators, per-row tag chips now amber/larger with × remove.
  - Bot feedback loop: flagged emails (Bot Review / ML override / no candidate) auto-recorded in `data/mail_scanner/feedback.jsonl` as candidates. Users see "✓ Correct" / "✗ Wrong" buttons on Bot Review emails; wrong opens correction selector (actionable/ack_suppress/owner_name_title/note_only/other). `POST /api/scanner/feedback` stores verdict; `GET /api/scanner/feedback` lists entries.
  - Learning pipeline: `train_ml_head.py` gains `--feedback` and `--mock-and-feedback` modes, `load_feedback_entries()` converts verdicts/corrections to labeled ML samples. `retrain_classifier_head()` in `mail_scanner.py` runs training as subprocess. `POST /api/scanner/retrain` endpoint + Scanner Admin "Retrain ML Head" button with feedback-count gating and accuracy display.
  - **Linking policy change:** scanner now guarantees every email is linked to the best opportunity (even weak matches) or flagged with Bot Review for human routing. Added `_ensure_linked_or_flagged()` wrapper around `_process_email_core()`, explicit `_link_email_to_opportunity()` calls in `supplement_discussion`, and weak-match linking for record-inbox ack/delay. Log UI updated to show "linked email" / "flagged for review" instead of "No action".
  - **Phase 8b: Enhanced Feedback + Inbox Differentiation (2026-07-13).**
    - Rules legend in Scanner Admin Status tab: collapsible `<details>` listing all 15 classification rules with matches, actions, record inbox behavior, and assignees.
    - Inbox differentiation: source channel badges (`CRM`/`REQ`) on each mail row showing classification, actions taken, and amber suggested action (e.g., "task needed") for record inbox emails where tasks are suppressed.
    - Inbox filter buttons: `All | CRM | REQ` in toolbar to filter by source channel.
    - Feedback on ALL rows: removed `hasBotReview` gate. Every email gets ✓/✗ buttons.
    - Structured correction form: "What was wrong?" dropdown (wrong classification/wrong deal/should notify customer/both/other), "Correct rule" dropdown, "Correct deal" type-ahead search, notes field.
    - Backend: `store_user_feedback()` accepts `correct_classification`, `correct_opp_id`, `correct_opp_title`. `record_feedback_candidate()` stores `linked_opp_id`, `linked_opp_title`, `source_inbox`.
    - Training: `load_feedback_entries()` uses `correct_classification` to relabel samples (preferred over `user_correction`).
    - Skipped actions in log: record inbox policy suppressions shown as `(skipped: task: record inbox policy, ...)` in Scanner Admin log.
  - Backend endpoints added to `scanner/scanner_service.py` and `server.py` with local fallback + remote proxy.
  - Files changed: `mail_scanner.py`, `train_ml_head.py`, `scanner/scanner_service.py`, `server.py`, `public/app.js`, `public/index.html`, `public/styles.css`.
  - Tested: Python syntax, feedback store, candidate recording, retrain in `.venv-ml` (50 samples → 100% accuracy).
  - Next: Browser test in local dashboard, commit/push, redeploy scanner container on CRM droplet, verify tag add/remove + feedback + retrain + guaranteed linking end-to-end on live bad cases.
- **Phase 6: ML Implementation & Override Logic (2026-07-12).** (see CHANGELOG)
- **Phase 5 ML scaffolding + Phase 6 admin UI polish + Phase 7 deploy prep done (2026-07-11).** (see CHANGELOG)
- **Phase 2 hygiene + ack/delay complete; Phase 3 tag mirroring + Phase 4 scanner service scaffold + bot-inbox hardening done (2026-07-11).** (see CHANGELOG)
- All on `email_scanner` only. No main commits.
- Git snapshot below.

This file is auto-loaded by Grok into the system prompt for every session in this directory tree. It provides persistent project context so you do **not** need a full "pick up where we left off" explanation or complete re-exploration on every new session. (See also user-guide 12-project-rules.md and 17-sessions.md.)

**Always:** 
- Resume prior work via TUI welcome screen (recent sessions for this cwd), `/load`, `grok --resume <id>`, or `-c` (continue most recent). Chat history + prior state is preserved in `~/.grok/sessions/...`.
- Still use tools (list_dir / read_file / grep / run_terminal_command for git etc.) to inspect *current* code state — files + docs are the source of truth.
- For new sessions: `cd <project-root>` (sets workspace/cwd for rules + session grouping).

## Project Overview & Architecture (high level, reuse these)
- Vanilla JS dashboard (no framework) + Python proxy for OnlyOffice CRM (Community Server / Workspace).
- **Frontend (public/):** 
  - index.html (modals, tiles, chrome)
  - app.js (main; state, rendering, api wrapper, profile sync, modals for deal-edit/create/quick-note/preview, group kanban, feed, tasks, calendars, notes)
  - styles.css
  - Static assets (favicons, ship logos)
- **Backend (dev/prod proxy):** server.py (proxies /api/proxy/* to portal, handles /api/user-profile, /api/calendar/feed, /api/dashboard-notes, auth via oo_token cookie).
- **Persistence (per CRM user + portal):** 
  - user_profile_store.py (data/user-profiles/.../*.json; versioned; supports groups, calendarTiles, notesTiles, groupTemplates, tileLayout, hiddenFeedKeys, feedKeywordFilter)
  - notes_store.py (for notes tiles content)
  - LocalStorage fallbacks + debounce server saves (scheduleUserProfileSave).
- **Tiles:** Opportunity groups (kanban with filters/stages/tags/red), fixed panels (feed/notifications, tasks), addable (calendars ICS, notes markdown). See Toaster_Features for ideas.
- **Key patterns to ALWAYS reuse:**
  - Profile: buildUserProfilePayload, applyUserProfile, loadUserProfileFromServer (prefers server), saveGroupsToStorage/scheduleUserProfileSave/saveUserProfileToServer, strip*RuntimeFields.
  - Tiles/layout: bindTileChrome, applyTileBodyCollapsed/applyTileLayoutClasses, createLayoutButtons, attachTileCollapseButton, tileLayout in state.
  - API: `api(path, opts)` + parseApiError (throws on !ok); all CRM calls go through /api/proxy + X-OnlyOffice-Portal header.
   - Errors: showToast(msg, true) only for non-transient; 5xx/unreachable now shows persistent right amber crash banner (text: "CRM is temporarily unreachable and may have crashed. Refresh again in 30 seconds or contact system administrator."); onCRMSuccess() hides it. Tiles always render (CRM pulls show empty content).
  - New tile type (if adding): follow checklist in Toaster_Features (add to HTML+JS chooser, persist in profile py + frontend, refresh policy, empty states, update docs).
  - Modals: reuse .modal / .modal-card / backdrop / data-*-dismiss / escape; openDealEditModal, confirmDialog.
  - History/feed: unwrapHistoryEvents, /api/2.0/crm/history/filter (entityType=opportunity), applyFeedKeywordFilter.
  - Groups: fetchOpportunitiesForGroup + buildFilterQuery, renderCard, setupGroupToolbar (templates, remove, filters).
   - After mutations (incl. note create/delete from side editor): renderXXX() + scheduleUserProfileSave() + optional openOpportunityPreviewModal refresh for side context.
- **Custom fields on create (ISSUE-001/FEAT-002):** Fully implemented and enabled (CREATE_OPP_USER_FIELDS_ENABLED=true). customFieldList with {key,value} camelCase added to create body. See ISSUES.md for root cause.
- **Do not:** Duplicate docs (link to FUTURE_FEATURES.md, ISSUES.md, Toaster_Features, docs/UPDATE_AND_DEPLOY.txt, README). No new abstractions unless the task requires. Prefer minimal changes following existing.

## Post-v1.2 shipped items (for reference)
All items from the explicit post-1.1 testing list + live feedback were completed for v1.2.0:
- Tile collapse/minimize (notes, calendar, groups with half/quarter width preserved while collapsed) + calendar double-height scaling.
- Immediate persistence on group remove.
- Tasks rows show description.
- Keyword filter: comma-separated = AND (every token required).
- Preview stays open on edit-from-preview.
- White favicon/logo.
- Friendly message for linked-email "not found".
- Full tasks-list modal (cabinet icon button, open+completed, show-completed toggle, check/uncheck via /close+/reopen, New Task, deep links, light readability styling).
- Template management: delete-only modal with × per template (no edit/rename).
- CRM crash/5xx banner (exact wording, 30s guidance, throttle, auto-clear, api() trigger).
- AGENTS.md added.
- FUTURE_FEATURES cleanup (crash item removed because shipped).

**v1.4.5 additions (most recent session work — read this first on next resume):**
- Side-by-side "quick edit" / note popup from opp preview: opens left of preview (desktop) or fixed top (mobile); both fully interactive; auto-refresh of preview history on submit; new manual ⟳ refresh button left of ✎; × delete on note history items in preview (confirm + DELETE /history/{id}).
- Presence AFD: "Away from dashboard" (subtle gray dot + section) for tab-away but active session vs true "offline" only on sign-out (server clears hb on /logout); 3h auto-logout; "Last CRM (proxy)" confirmed only from real proxied calls.
- Feed: today's notifications get subtle white left border line (`.feed-item-today`).
- Crash resilience: on 502/5xx (api + presence), persistent right-side amber banner ("CRM temporarily unreachable... refresh in 30s or contact admin"); no raw toasts; tiles *all* render (CRM ones empty/no-content, local features work); banner hides only on successful CRM response.
- Quick note side submit now reliably refreshes preview.
- **Mobile fixes (3):** bot/event-log buttons stacked below sign-out (Option A, bot swapped to rightmost on mobile); opp preview modal fills screen width; presence stale autoStatus leak fixed (modal + tile) + poll failure no longer wipes team roster. See CHANGELOG.md.
- All changes in v1.4.5 release notes + full deploy checklist followed (local close, git tag/push, prod docker + VERIFY blocks). Update AGENTS on every release.

See CHANGELOG.md and docs/RELEASE_v1.2.md. AccuLynx research stays in FUTURE_FEATURES under Other ideas (not implemented). 

For the previous post-v1.1 list and implementation notes, consult the git history / session artifacts around the v1.2 commits.

Legacy open items (lower priority unless asked): FEAT-003 attachments, new toasters (stale deals, closing this week, etc.), FEAT-022 docs tile.

## Architecture & Deployment Context
- The **dashboard** (this entire project) runs on its own DigitalOcean Ubuntu droplet (production: https://dashboard.publicadjustermidwest.com, currently 159.89.229.126). It serves the vanilla JS UI from `public/` and acts as an API proxy (`server.py`) that forwards CRM calls to the OnlyOffice server while handling user profiles, notes, calendars, and auth.
- The **OnlyOffice CRM** (Community Server / Workspace) runs on a **completely separate** DigitalOcean droplet. The two servers communicate over public HTTPS.
- **Local testing workflow (mandatory before any push):**
  - All development and verification happens on the developer's machine (this laptop).
  - Use `./start.sh` (normal dev server) or `python test-server.py` (special chaos/failure simulation server) for local testing.
  - The local servers are **only for testing features and fixes**. They are never used in production.
  - After local verification (browser + DevTools, including simulated failures for the mutation queue), commit and `git push`.
  - On the production dashboard droplet: `git pull`, `docker compose build`, `docker compose up -d` (see docs/UPDATE_AND_DEPLOY.txt and docs/DEPLOY_v1.1_VERIFY_STEPS.md for the exact safe checklist).
- **Critical separation rule:** This project is a **standalone dashboard**. It is deliberately kept completely separate from OnlyOffice so there is zero risk of it affecting or breaking the OnlyOffice Community Server installation. The `onlyoffice-module/` directory (if present) is legacy/separate and not used for the main dashboard. Local test servers exist solely to allow safe iteration on the JS + proxy code before deploying the standalone dashboard.
- **Production shared-hosting note:** The dashboard droplet also runs other web apps. As of 2026-07, public traffic for `dashboard.publicadjustermidwest.com` is handled by the **host's nginx** (systemd service at `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/dashboard.publicadjustermidwest.com`), **not** the Docker `estimate-nginx` container. The dashboard container binds to `127.0.0.1:8765`. The dashboard is in a separate Compose project but joins `estimate-enhancer_estimate-network` (harmless). **Required for uploads:** `client_max_body_size 100m; proxy_request_buffering off; proxy_read_timeout 120s;` in the host site file. Always read `docs/DASHBOARD_INFRASTRUCTURE.md` (especially the 2026-07 section) before touching nginx on the host. The old `/opt/estimate-enhancer/nginx.conf` is historical for this domain.

## How to Run / Test / Deploy
- **Dev (normal):** `cd ~/crm-kanban && cp -n config.example.env .env && ./start.sh` (or `python3 server.py`). Opens http://127.0.0.1:8765. Login with your OnlyOffice CRM credentials (sets the `oo_token` cookie used by the proxy).
- **Scanner local testing:** Scanner runs inside the dashboard server. Use `SCANNER_ENABLED=true` in .env. Dry-run mode (all toggles false) is safe — no tasks/notes/deals created. To test ML training: `pip install -r requirements-ml.txt && python3 train_ml_head.py --generate-mock --samples 300`.
- **Scanner production deployment:** Push to GitHub, then on CRM droplet (68.183.130.39): `git pull && docker build --build-arg INSTALL_ML=1 -t vanguard-mail-scanner -f scanner/Dockerfile . && docker run -d --name vanguard-mail-scanner -v scanner-data:/app/data -e ML_ENABLED=true -e SCANNER_CRM_EMAIL=bot@vanguardadj.com -e SCANNER_CRM_PASSWORD=... vanguard-mail-scanner`. Train inside container: `docker exec -it vanguard-mail-scanner python3 train_ml_head.py --generate-mock --samples 300`.
- **Special test server (for mutation queue / offline resilience testing):** `python test-server.py`. This version supports controllable chaos mode (via `/api/test/chaos`) so you can simulate 5xx errors, delays, and network problems. (The client-side mutation queue / offline resilience is a completed implementation.)
- **Test changes:** Browser + DevTools (Network tab for proxy/crm calls, Application → Local Storage for queue/profile, offline mode or the test server's chaos toggle). Always test both happy path and failure/retry scenarios for any new resilience code. Have test groups, tasks (with descriptions), history events, etc.
- **No tests:** No automated suite; manual + visual + simulated failure testing.
- **Agent memory rule (critical):** The agent has repeatedly forgotten completed work (e.g. backdate HTML inputs implemented and tested locally were never present in the committed tree; only JS/CSS were pushed). Going forward: after every feature or fix, explicitly confirm the exact files changed, run `git status --short && git diff --stat`, write a one-line summary in AGENTS.md under "Last session summary", and ensure the CHANGELOG entry exists before ending the session. Do not trust prior "done" claims without re-verifying the on-disk + git state. User will no longer argue; the record must be written.
- **Deploy:** See docs/UPDATE_AND_DEPLOY.txt (stop local server, edit, test locally, git commit + push). Then on the production droplet follow the safe pull + rebuild steps in docs/DEPLOY_v1.1_VERIFY_STEPS.md. Never skip the VERIFY blocks.
- **Debug:** server.py (or test-server.py) logs, browser console, `grep` in the codebase, read the exact function. The mutation queue processor runs in the browser (localStorage + background timer + online/visibility listeners).
- **Profile data:** `data/user-profiles/...` (gitignored); survives restarts on both local and production.

## Coding Conventions (follow existing)
- **Icons/buttons:** Always check https://tabler.io/icons first for new icons. Use inline SVG from Tabler (24x24 viewBox, `stroke="currentColor"`, `stroke-width="2"`). Prefix: `icon-tabler-link`, `icon-tabler-clipboard-x`, etc.
- Vanilla JS + CSS; no new libs.
- Reuse helpers (formatMoney, unwrap, escapeHtml, crmOpportunityUrl, historyEventDate, customField* etc.).
- State in `state = { groups, ... }`; render functions are idempotent (find or create tile).
- After state change that should persist: the *ToStorage() + scheduleUserProfileSave().
- Comments for non-obvious (esp. CRM API quirks).
- Update docs (FUTURE/ISSUES/CHANGELOG) when adding/fixing.
- For new features: add to Add Tile if applicable; document in Toaster_Features/FUTURE.
- Keep changes minimal and isolated.
- On edit: prefer search_replace for precision; read first.

## Other
- Acculynx research findings live in FUTURE_FEATURES.md (do not lose them).
- When in doubt on priority: user's explicit list > FUTURE suggested order.
- For sessions: prefer resume over new. If new session, AGENTS.md + tools get you oriented fast.
- Questions during work: use ask_user_question for narrow choices.

Update this file when conventions or priorities change.

## Known agent failure mode
- Repeatedly forgets completed work (backdate HTML, changelog entries, etc.).
- Either overwrites or never commits verified changes.
- Going forward: every feature/fix must be explicitly confirmed on disk, `git status --short && git diff --stat` run, a one-line summary written here, and the CHANGELOG entry added before the session ends. No arguing; the record is the source of truth.
