# Changelog

All notable changes to the CRM Kanban dashboard are documented here.

## [1.1.0] — 2026-06-05

See also [docs/RELEASE_v1.1.md](./docs/RELEASE_v1.1.md) for the full GitHub release text.

### Fixes
- CRM notifications feed empty after pagination refactor — restored bulk history + mail loading.
- Feed no longer shows “no events” while mail/history is still loading.
- Hidden notifications: server-backed entries with snapshots; restore via toolbar modal.
- Archived notes tiles no longer auto-deleted from server profile.
- Removed non-working archived-notes UI from **Add tile** (moved to notes **File** menu).
- Group profile saves omit embedded opportunity lists (refetch on expand).

### CRM notifications (new / improved)
- **90-day** feed window (was 30).
- **200-event** load cap.
- Loading spinner in feed header; scroll to load more (until cap).
- 5-minute in-session feed cache.
- Hidden-notifications manager (hide per item, review/restore, 30-day retention).

### Notes tiles (new / improved)
- Server persistence per user; archive retained on server.
- **File** menu: `.txt` / `.md` export, archive, duplicate, **restore from archive** (by date → fills current note).
- Presets: **Daily**, **Claim checklist** (CRM checkbox fields).
- Quarter width; Edit/Preview; icon toolbar; save footer (time + stats).
- Removed link-deal from notes; **Daily Standup** renamed to **Daily**.

### Dashboard performance
- Minimized tiles skip CRM fetches until expanded.
- Parallel login bootstrap; deferred per-card custom-field enrichment (`IntersectionObserver`).

### UI
- **Red X** remove icon (groups, calendar, notes).
- **Save template** floppy-disk icon on groups.
- Minimize + icon-based layout controls on all tiles.
- Kanban card **preview** → opportunity preview modal.
